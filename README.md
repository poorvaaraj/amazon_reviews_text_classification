# amazon_reviews_text_classification

* In this project, the implementation of a machine learning model, 'Text classification-Amazon Reviews' is performed. 
* This machine learning model aims to classify text reviews given by customers to identify the Rating associated with that review on a scale of 1-5. 
* Further based on these reviews product category is identified, whether the product is a musical instrument or a video game.
* This machine learning model was built using supervised learning algorithms- Logistic regression and Linear support vector classifier. 
* In order to implement the machine learning model, Initially Data quality assessment followed by Exploratory data analysis was carried out. 
* As some data columns are in text format, text Pre-processing is performed in order to transform the data into clean and
noiseless format. 
* After text Pre-processing, the data frame is split into train and test data for systematic evaluation. Further, we fit the data into respective machine learning model and make prediction. In order to evaluate the data various evaluation matrices were used to examine reliability of model.
